    <p><h1>THE PURPOSE OF MARRIAGE</p></h1>
    
    <p>There is the need to know why God instituted marriage. Like the popular saying: <em>'where the purpose of a thing is not known abuse is inevitable'</em>.</p>
    <p>We need to know the purpose of marriage so that we do not abuse this holy institution created by God. Marriage originated from God and God alone. It is not from any of our ancestors, neither is it from science, Mohammed, 'god of love', or any goddess.</p>
    	<p><strong><em>"So God created manin His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea..."</strong>-Gen. 1:27-28</em></p>
    <p>The passage above is a summary of how God created marriage. Now, let us go into why marriage was instituted.</p>
    <h3>1. TO AVOID LONELINESS WITH LIMITATIONS</h3>
      <p><strong><em>"And the Lord God said, it is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him"</strong>-Gen.2:18.</em></p>
    <p>The first purpose of marriage is clearly stated in this verse. God knows that the man will not be able to accomplish all the things he needed to accomplish on earth without a suitable help meet.</p>
    <p>Though there were other animals, Adam was still lonely in their midst, that is why he was unable to choose any of them as his companion.</p>
